# 📊 Sustainable Abalone Harvesting — R-Based Data Analysis

### Overview
This project explores sustainable harvesting strategies for abalone, an economically valuable marine species. Using R for statistical modeling, data wrangling, and visualization, we analyze biological and harvest-related features to evaluate potential overfishing risks and suggest sustainable practices.

This is a two-part assignment completed as part of a graduate-level statistics course. It is now combined here as one comprehensive data science project.

### 🔍 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis on abalone harvest datasets.

Investigate relationships between biological features (e.g., length, diameter, rings) and harvest potential.

Fit and evaluate regression models to predict age and other characteristics.

Draw conclusions about sustainability and harvesting guidelines based on data.

### 📈 Key Findings
Strong correlation observed between age and physical dimensions like length and diameter.

Regression models show predictive potential but also highlight variance concerns.

Logistic regression provides insight into binary harvest decisions based on biological characteristics.

Sustainability thresholds were explored using model-based decision boundaries.
